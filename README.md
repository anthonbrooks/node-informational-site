# node-informational-site

This project is an introduction to serving files with nodeJS. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, nodeJS

HTML creates a static site.  

JavaScript is used in index.js to serve the html files with nodeJS.

## Optimizations

*Optimizations will be made in the future as my knowledge of Javascript grows!*

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to properly serve files by importing http and fs. These modules alongside nodeJS allow me to create a server on my local environment to serve my webpages. With this I can render up my own server for my future projects. 

I also learned how to handle errors and set the status code for the browser to display if there is success rendering the page or a server/file error.
